Activities: Week 11 
===================

.. note::

  These Assignments May Change As the Semester Progresses

* **Before class Monday:**

  * Read *part* of the :ref:`Advanced Accumulation <list_comp_chap>` chapter (see below listed sections). Note that the sections assigned may reference the sections you are not assigned, but don't worry too much about that -- feel free to check them out if you think they will help your understanding. We will not cover that material in much detail, but we WILL cover the material in the assigned sections!
  * Read the entire chapter on :ref:`Testing <test_cases_chap>`.


* **Before class Wednesday:**

	* Read the :ref:`Requests and OAuth <requests_oauthlib>` chapter on another, mechanical, way of accessing APIs that use the OAuth 1 protocol, and discusses paging results from API requests. 
	* NOTE: We do not have code pertaining to this chapter on Canvas yet but will discuss this, and other code, in the next couple lectures.
	* Check out this link to the documentation on the `Tweepy library <http://pythonhosted.org/tweepy/api.html#tweepy-api-twitter-api-wrapper>`_. Don't worry about understanding it all, we'll discuss in class.


* **By Sunday at 11:59 PM:**

	* Submit your Problem Set 10 and your DYU 10 to Canvas
  * **NOTE:** This is the last DYU that is required! However, if you missed any DYUs along the way, you have 1 more opportunity to submit DYUs pertaining to material we cover during the remainder of the semester, and/or material you come to new confusion / new understanding of during the process of completing the final project. More on this in class & announcement!

  


.. _problem_set_10:

Problem Set
-----------

* Find files to download and instructions on Canvas at Files > Problem Sets > PS10 (when published). There are 2, but the `black_box.py` file need simply be saved in the same directory as your problem set file. You do not need to look at it and should not alter it at all.

* **You should submit** `to the Problem Set 10 assignment <updatelink.com>`_:

  * Your edited problem set file

**In this problem set, you will:**

* Use list comprehensions with mapping and filtering patterns to build new lists out of extant lists
* Use existing class definitions to create instances
* Write unit tests for code based on descriptions we give you, and find bugs in code we've provided by writing tests!
