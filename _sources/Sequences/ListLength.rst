List Length
-----------

As with strings, the function ``len`` returns the length of a list (the number
of items in the list).  However, since lists can have items which are themselves sequences (e.g., strings), 
it important to note that ``len`` only returns the top-most length.

.. activecode:: chp09_01a

    alist =  ["hello", 2.0, 5]
    print len(alist)
    print len(alist[0])

Note that ``alist[0]`` is the string ``"hello"``, which has length 5. 

**Check your understanding**

.. mchoice:: test_question9_2_1 
   :answer_a: 4
   :answer_b: 5
   :feedback_a: len returns the actual number of items in the list, not the maximum index value.
   :feedback_b: Yes, there are 5 items in this list.
   :correct: b

   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     alist = [3, 67, "cat", 3.14, False]
     print len(alist)
    
        
.. mchoice:: test_question9_2_2 
   :answer_a: 2
   :answer_b: 3
   :answer_c: 4
   :answer_d: 5
   :feedback_a: The list begins with the second item of L and includes everything up to but not including the last item.
   :feedback_b: Yes, there are 3 items in this list.
   :feedback_c: The list begins with the second item of L and includes everything up to but not including the last item.
   :feedback_d: The list begins with the second item of L and includes everything up to but not including the last item.
   :correct: b

   What is printed by the following statements?
   
   .. code-block:: python

     L = [0.34, '6', 'SI106', 'Python', -2]
     print len(L[1:-1])
